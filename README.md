# Food Journal App: Debugging and Fixes

During the development of the Food Journal application, several significant issues arose that required careful analysis and correction. The main difficulties were related to initializing the database, executing SQL queries, and working with user interface components such as ScrollView and SwipeListView.

## Issues and Solutions

### 1. Database Initialization Error

**Error:**
Database initialization error: `[TypeError: Cannot read property 'execAsync' of undefined]`

**Root Cause:**
The `execAsync` method was being called on an undefined object (`tx`). In newer versions of expo-sqlite, the `execAsync` method can only be called directly on the database instance (`db`) and not within a transaction context.

**Solution:**
Replaced the incorrect code with the correct implementation:

**Incorrect Code:**
```javascript
await db.withTransactionAsync(async (tx) => {
  await tx.execAsync(
    `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      email TEXT UNIQUE,
      password TEXT
    );`
  );
});

**Ð¡orrect Code:**
```javascript
await db.withTransactionAsync(async () => {
  await db.execAsync(
    `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      email TEXT UNIQUE,
      password TEXT
    );`
  );
});
